# skycadet-flight-sim
✈️ SkyCadet - My first individual project as part of Code Institute's AI Augmented Full Stack Development Bootcamp. A fictional flight simulator center website built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Focused on responsive design, accessibility, and a clean user experience with simple booking/contact features.
